3. [Epsilon NFA to DFA](/03-enfa-to-dfa)
4. [Regular Expression to NFA and DFA](/04-re-to-nfa-dfa)
5. [Prefix, Postfix, and Infix Operations](/05-expression-conversions)
6. [First and Follow Sets](/06-first-follow)
7. [Eliminating Left Recursion](/07-eliminate-left-recursion)
8. [Left Factoring Algorithms](/08-left-factoring)
9. [Three-Address Code Generation](/09-three-address-code)
10. [LR Parsing](/10-lr-parsing)
